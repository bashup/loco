# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram                  # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch            # watch files and re-run tests or other commands
dk use: shell-console         # make the "console" command enter a subshell

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

dk.rebuild() {

    require     realpaths basher install bashup/realpaths
    bashpackr --pack ./loco bin/loco
